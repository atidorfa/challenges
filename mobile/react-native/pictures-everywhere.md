# Pictures everywhere!

Taking pictures is fun, but let's attach the location where the picture has been taken from.

The main goal is to build an app able to take pictures and save it along with the device's location. Users will be able to see the pictures with the location where they've been taken from.

Screens:

- Splash screen:

- Main screen:

- Take picture screen:

- Picture screen:


## Considerations:

- Mobile app will have to be develped using React Native.
- Wireframes provided are intended to serve as a guide and provide clarification about the scope.
- Final designs is up to you.
- BONUS: if you can implement something like "Share this picture" is a plus!
