# Pictures everywhere!

Taking pictures is fun, but let's grab the location where the picture has been taken from.

The main goal is to build an app able to take pictures and save it along with the device's location. Users will be able to see the pictures with the location where they've been taken from.

Screens:

- Splash screen: This is the initial screen, it will show up for some seconds showing a "loading" or "welcome" text.

- Main screen: This will contain the pictures taken by user as thumbnails listed one next to the other as "mosaic" view. Also this screen has the "Take picture" action.

- Take picture screen: This will open up the device's camera so the user can take the picture and grab the location coordinates using GPS. You can come back to the main screen using the "back" action at the top - left.

- Picture screen: This will show the picture in full size along with the location. You can come back to the main screen using the "back" action at the top - left.

### Wireframes:

## Considerations:

- Mobile app will have to be develped using React Native.
- Github repository will be provided with source code for review and build app.
- Wireframes provided are intended to serve as a guide and give clarification about the scope.
- Final designs is up to you.
- BONUS: if you can implement something like "Share this picture" is a plus!
